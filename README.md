### A Simple Effort to Keep Stories Alive

Some stories were never meant to be written. They were sung under moonlight, whispered at bedtime, or shared in the quiet language of rituals. But as time moves forward, many of these stories — and the voices that carry them — are disappearing.

This project is my small, imperfect way of holding onto them.

The idea is simple: someone uploads a voice recording — maybe a story their grandmother told, a prayer from their childhood, or a forgotten song from their village. The app listens and gently writes it down. It summarizes the heart of it in plain words. Then it finds an image that feels like it belongs to that moment.

There’s no perfection here. Just an honest attempt to make sure that when voices fade, their echoes remain.

### 🛠 What It’s Made Of
- **Python 3**
- **Streamlit** — for a clean, simple interface
- **Whisper** (coming soon) — to listen better
- **Transformers** (coming soon) — to understand more deeply
- **CLIP** (coming soon) — to connect words with images
- **Pillow** — to show pictures like pages in a memory book

### ❤️ Why This Exists
Because stories matter.
Because culture is more than data.
Because someone, somewhere, may one day want to hear what their ancestors sounded like — and they deserve the chance.

This is not just a project. It’s a gentle way to honor the past, using the tools of the present.
